# Gesture-Control-Remote

The need –
There has been tremendous growth in terms of content that’s available to us on Television. However, the way we interact with the TV is still etched in good-old-days. Why do we need a remote control for television? The battery keeps dying, remotes keep falling in living room corners, and they require replacement more often than not (thus adding costs). What if we could control television using gestures? This is just the tip of the proverbial opportunity-iceberg.
Business value –
a. Interacting with television using gestures opens up a complete new design landscape. Content creators can leverage and allow users to interact with content (not just television) in more creative ways. Think of what happened when users started using touch to interact with their phones (an explosion of apps and whole new world got created)
b. Remotes are messy and so old school (and so not cool). Removing this piece of hardware from the equation brings down initial and recurring costs.
c. Remotes consume lead batteries which damage environment. The proposed solution is environment friendly
The solution –
Using a simple prototype built using Python and Open Source libraries we have developed a solution where the user can interact with television using simple hand gestures. Hand gestures like closing fist, like swipe left, swipe right and more.
The solution is implemented using PyChromecast Python package and has been tested using Google Chromecast device. The solution requires only commodity web camera and open source software to run. Very low cost and efficient.
